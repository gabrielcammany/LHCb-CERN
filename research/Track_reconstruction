Track reconstruction will create tracks from the predicted hits in the NN model from PredictAllStationLayers_NN.

Data Features found: 

    - Slope of X0 vs X1 (8190 particles)
        Mean 0.016
        Variance 0.440
        
    - Slope of X0 vs U
        Mean -0.062931 
        Variance 3.852878 
        
    - Slope of V vs U
        Mean 0.019983 
        Variance 3.943988 
        
    - Slope of X1 vs U
        Mean 0.077136 
        Variance 3.207860 

In order to reduce the number of hits, I have applied:

    Layer 3:
    
    - Removed all hits with slope bigger or equal to 0.9
    - Removed all hits with a difference from the X0 bigger or equal to 180
    - Positive hits:
        * If the predicted X1 is bigger than the real X0, get all hits bigger than X0
        * Remove all hits smaller than the predicted position minous 10. 
    - Negative hits:
        * If the predicted X1 is smaller than the real X0, get all hits smaller than X0
        * Remove all hits bigger than the predicted position plus 10. 

    Layer 2:
    
    - Removed all hits with slope bigger or equal to 1.5
    - Removed all hits with a difference from the X0 bigger or equal to 220
    - Positive hits:
        * arr_layer2 > predicted[1] - 60
        * arr_layer2 < predicted[1] + 150
    - Negative hits:
        * arr_layer2 < predicted[1] + 60
        * arr_layer2 > predicted[1] - 150
